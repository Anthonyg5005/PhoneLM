# PhoneLM
## Running language models on a phone

This is the example code for running a powerful (*as much as a 2019 phone can handle*) language model on my Google Pixel 4 using the `languagemodels` python module. You can find the module on [GitHub](https://github.com/jncraton/languagemodels).

You can find the demo through this [Ngrok tunnel][replacewithlinkwhenfinished]

I run this using [Termux](https://termux.dev/en/) on Ubuntu version 22.04 from [Andronix](https://andronix.app/).

I don't believe you need to have a rooted device for any of this, but I will say my phone is running rooted Pixel OS.

Wouldn't be possible, or at least this easy, without [languagemodels](https://github.com/jncraton/languagemodels) and its dependencies.
